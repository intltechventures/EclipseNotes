## Eclipse Pain Points 

### 2019-06-09 Update - "Good-bye, Eclipse"

Given the impressive growth and expansion within the Visual Studio Code marketplace - to support Open Source tools and languages - I am making a decision to shift my primary coding to use the Microsoft Visual Studio Code - and Microsoft Visual Studio IDEs.  
     
I feel that Eclipse as a platform has chosen a path toward ruin. Given the increased pace of their releases - that habitually break older plugins - I can no longer, in good faith, recommend it as a tool for my clients. In the last few years, I have grown increasingly frustrated with the level of pain it represents - for an increasingly diminishing value proposition. It is a sad ending - and I have too long been relunctant to make a final decision to switch.   
     
I may, from time-to-time, come back and experiment with Eclipse - and if I find some useful plugins - that are uniquely, and only, available within the Eclipse ecosphere - I will likely add some new sections to this document.
