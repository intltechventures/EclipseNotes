  + "Goodbye to Eclipse - the end of an era as an Eclipse plugin developer."

  + "I've been an Eclipse plug-in developer for over 7 years now, for nearly all of my software engineer career. Notably, I have been the lead developer of 3 open-source Eclipse IDEs: RustDT, Goclipse, and DDT. But with some pain, I've decided to change my career tech focus, and stop working with Eclipse IDE development altogether."

  + "For several years now, Eclipse has been declining in popularity, and in my opinion also declining in comparative quality to other IDEs. I've seen the issues Eclipse has, both external (functionality, UI design, bugs), and internal (code debt, shortage of manpower). I was holding on to the hope it would recover, but now I don't see much of a future for Eclipse other than a legacy existence, and I realize exiting was long overdue."

  + "Google too announced they were pulling out their developers from the core Eclipse team:"

    * "Eclipse usage within Google has dropped to the point where it no longer makes sense to have a team of engineers contributing to the Eclipse project. This means that in the next few months my team will be dismantled and I will be reassigned to something else."
