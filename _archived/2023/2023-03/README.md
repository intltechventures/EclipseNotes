## Eclipse Marketplace Plugins

    * "This marketplace solution provides Java 20 support for Eclipse 2023-03 (4.27). To install the feature place ensure you have the latest Eclipse release, which is 4.27."

    * KM NOTE: Another Eclipse IDE plugin ```shit-show```. I ran into some issue trying to get this plugin to install...and it kept trying to re-install - but didn't give me any error message. I think this support was perhaps added to the main update site - so the additional plugin may no longer need to be installed (?)
